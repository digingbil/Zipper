# Zipper
PHP Tool to make site archives (backups). 

Ho to use it:
-------------

1.  Place the Zipper.php file in your desired folder, usually your site's root folder. For example
    
    /user/public\_html/my\_site/Zipper.php
    
2.  And run it through the browser like
    
    https://mysite.com/Zipper.php
    
3.  Choose if you want to make a DB dump as well. Currently this is working only with Joomla! and WordPress sites.

4. Click Start Zipping and wait for it to finish. 

5. When done you will be presented with a fullpath to your backup and a Download button as a way to get the archive locally.

6. Optionally you can also "Delete all zipper archive files" and delete the script itself by clicking on "Delete the Zipper.php from the server" button. Keep in mind that if you click on "Delete the Zipper.php" the action will also delete all backup archive files created previously!

7. Enjoy.
